            Hi! I'm Peak, a game programmer and designer from Thailand, and I've
            graduated from Bangkok University studying Information Technology
            and Innovation, major Games and Interactive Media.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            Here you can see some of the projects I've been working on. I have a
            strong perseverance for learning new things and taking on
            challenges, and I always like to put some extra time in polishing my
            creations, to make sure the creative vision is achieved in the best
            possible way. I've always been extremely curious in the technical
            side of games, and sometimes this curiosity has led me to projects I
            won't be able to formally mention here. Sometimes I also make
            websites, like this one. If you have any questions please feel free
            to contact me :)
